"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction In April of 2020, the Society for Ecosystem Restoration Northern British Columbia (SERNbc) undertook an initiative to plan and conduct fish passage restoration planning activities in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups which are sub-basins of the Skeena River watershed. The initiative was supported by a grant from the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund that leveraged funds committed in the fall of 2019 from the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and the Canadian Wildlife Federation. New Graph Environment and Hillcrest Geographics were the project team subcontracted to devise the study plan, submit proposals and complete the work which included information gathering, updating/implementation of open source data analysis tools, fish passage assessments and habitat confirmation assessments. Although fish passage restoration planning was conducted for both the Morice River watershed group and the Bulkley River watershed group, on the ground surveys in 2020 focused primarily within Bulkley River tributaries. In August of 2020, following a province wide prioritization exercise and a series of workshops, the Canadian Wildlife Federation selected the Bulkley River watershed group as a target watershed for connectivity planning efforts supported by a grant from the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund. A Fish Passage Working Group consisting of First Nations, non-profits, stakeholder groups and regulators was established for the Bulkley River watershed group in the fall of 2020 as documented in Mazany-Wright et al. (2021). Recognizing synergies between the two initiatives, select project activities of both initiatives became a collaboration between SERNbc and CWF with extensive input from numerous organizations and individuals connected to the watersheds. This report builds on reporting from field activities conducted in 2021 (Irvine 2021) and 2022 which can be viewed interactively here and here. Please note that at the time of reporting, this document was a living document changing over time. Version numbers are logged for each release with modifications, enhancements and other changes tracked here with issues tracked here. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As road crossing structures are commonly upgraded or removed there are numerous opportunities to restore connectivity by ensuring that fish passage considerations are incorporated into repair, replacement, relocation and deactivation designs. Although remediation and replacement of stream crossing structures can have benefits to local fish populations, the costs of remedial works can be significant and the impacts of the work often complex to evaluate and quantify. Additionally, allocation of ecosystem restoration funding towards infrastructure upgrades on transportation right of ways are not always considered ethical under all circumstances from all perspectives. When funds are finite and invested groups are engaged in fund raising, cost benefits and the ethics of crossing replacements should be explored collaboratively alongside the cost benefits and ethics of alternative investment activities including transportation corridor relocation/deactivation, land procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian/floodplain restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, salt water interventions and research.

The Wet’suwet’en people are a matrilineal society organized into the Gilseyhu (Big Frog), Laksilyu (Small Frog), Tsayu (Beaver clan), Gitdumden (Wolf/Bear) and Laksamshu (Fireweed) clans. Within each of the clans there are are a number of kin-based groups known as Yikhs or House groups. The Yikh is a partnership between the people and the territory. Thirteen Yikhs with Hereditary Chiefs manage a total of 38 distinct territories upon which they have jurisdiction. Within a clan, the head Chief is entrusted with the stewardship of the House territory to ensure the Land is managed in a sustainable manner. Inuk Nu’at’en (Wet’suwet’en law) governing the harvesting of fish within their lands are based on values founded on thousands of years of social, subsistence and environmental dynamics. The Yintahk (Land) is the centre of life as well as culture and it’s management is intended to provide security for sustaining salmon, wildlife, and natural foods to ensure the health and well-being of the Wet’suwet’en (Office of the Wet’suwet’en 2013; “Office of the Wet’suwet’en” 2021; FLNRORD 2017). 2.2 Gitxsan Gitxsan means “People of the River Mist”. The Gitxsan Laxyip (traditional territories) covers an area of 33,000km2 within the Skeena River and Nass River watersheds. The Laxyip is governed by 60 Simgiigyet (Hereditary Chiefs), within the traditional hereditary system made up of Wilps (House groups). Anaat are fisheries tenures found throughout the Laxyip. Traditional governance within a matrilineal society operates under the principles of Ayookw (Gitxsan law) (“Gitxsan Huwilp Government” 2021). Many band members live in Hazelton, Kispiox and Glen Vowell (the Eastern Gitxsan) as well as within Kitwanga, Kitwankool and Kitsegukla (the Western Gitxsan) (Powell, Jensen, and Pedersen 2018). # Salmon is considered the source of life and always treated with high regard. It was brought by the Raven who also taught people how to fish and hunt. # The original Gitxsan economy depended heavily on the trade of fish and other natural resources with neighbouring First Nations along &quot;grease trails,&quot; which are routes named so because they carried the refined oil of the oolichan, a fish that resembles a smelt that is common in some areas of British Columbia. They are also known for their range of traditional arts 2.3 Project Location knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/fishpassage_overview.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Areas 2.3.1 Bulkley River The Bukley River is an 8th order stream that drains an area of 7,762 km2 in a generally northerly direction from Bulkley Lake on the Nechako Plateau to its confluence with the Skeena River at Hazleton. It has a mean annual discharge of 139.2 m3/s at station 08EE004 located near Quick (~27km south of Telkwa) and 19.4 m3/s at station 08EE003 located upstream near Houston. Flow patterns at Quick are heavily influenced by inflows from the Morice River (enters just downstream of Houston) resulting in flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.3). The hydrograph peaks faster and generally earlier (May - June) for the Bulkley River upstream of Houston where the topography is of lower lower elevation (Figures 2.2 and 2.4). Changes to the climate systems are causing impacts to natural and human systems on all continents with alterations to hydrological systems caused by changing precipitation or melting snow and ice increasing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as floods and droughts (IPCC 2014; ECCC 2016). These changes are resulting in modifications to the quantity and quality of water resources throughout British Columbia and are likely to compound issues related to drought and flooding in the Bulkley River watershed where numerous water licenses are held with a potential over-allocation of flows identified during low flow periods (ILMB 2007). The valley bottom has seen extensive settlement over the past hundred years with major population centers including the Village of Hazelton, the Town of Smithers, the Village of Telkwa and the District Municipality of Houston. As a major access corridor to northwestern British Columbia, Highway 16 and the Canadian National Railway are major linear developments that run along the Bulkley River within and adjacent to the floodplain with numerous crossing structures impeding fish access into and potentially out from important fish habitats. Additionally, as the valley bottom contains some of the most productive land in the area, there has been extensive conversion of riparian ecosystems to hayfields and pastures leading to alterations in flow regimes, increases in water temperatures, reduced streambank stability, loss of overstream cover and channelization (ILMB 2007; Wilson and Rabnett 2007). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004) and near Houston (Station #08EE003). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River at Quick (Station #08EE004 - daily discharge data from 1930 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) Figure 2.4: Summary of hydrology statistics for Bulkley River near Houston (Station #08EE003 - daily discharge data from 1980 to 2018). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EE003.png&quot;) 2.3.2 Morice River The Morice River watershed drains 4,379 km2 of Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau in a generally south-eastern direction. The Morice River is an 8th order stream that flows approximatley 80km from Morice Lake to the confluence with the upper Bulkley River just north of Houston. Major tributaries include the Nanika River, the Atna River, Gosnell Creek and the Thautil River. There area numerous large lakes situated on the south side of the watershed including Morice Lake, McBride Lake, Stepp Lake, Nanika Lake, Kid Price Lake, Owen Lake and others. There is one active hydrometric station on the mainstem of the Morice River near the outlet of Morice Lake and one historic station that was located at the mouth of the river near Houston that gathered data in 1971 only (Environment and limate Change Canada 2021). An estimate of mean annual discharge for the one year of data available for the Morice near it’s confluence with the Bulkley River is 113.3 m3/s. Mean annual discharge is estimated at 75.4 m3/s at station 08ED002 located near the outlet of Morice Lake. Flow patterns are typical of high elevation watersheds influenced by coastal weather patterns which receive large amounts of winter precipitation as snow in the winter and large precipitation events in the fall. This leads to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July with isolated high flows related to rain and rain on snow events common in the fall (Figures 2.5 - 2.6). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED003.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08ED002.png&quot;) Figure 2.5: Left: Hydrograph for Morice River near Houston (Station #08ED003 - 1971 data only).

Available daily discharge data from 1961 to 2018. 2.3.3 Zymoetz River The Zymoetz River (known locally as the Copper River) watershed is an eighth order stream that drains an area of 3,028 km2 in a generally westerly direction. It is considered a major tributary of the Skeena River, as it contributes approximately 10% of the flow. The headwater lakes are located approximately 20km southwest of Smithers, and they include Aldrich, Dennis and McDonell Lakes. The upper and lower portions of the watershed are accessed via logging roads off of Highway 16 from Smithers and Terrace, respectively. Access to the middle watershed is difficult due to road wash out. The Zymoetz River flows roughly 120km, starting just west of Hudson Bay mountain near Smithers and ending at the confluence of the Skeena River, approximately 8km north-east of Terrace. Elevations in the watershed range from 120m at the confluence, to 2740m in the Howson Range. The lower end of the Zymoetz watershed has seen a significant reduction in riparian habitat due to fires, forest development practices, pipe line and road construction (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). Snowmelt plays a big role in controlling the stream hydrology, with a mean annual discharge estimated at 105.3 m3/s at station 08EF005 located near Smithers. Peak discharge happens in May to early June, which is typical of a high elevation watershed like this (Figures 2.7 - 2.8). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EF005.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) Figure 2.7: Hydrograph for Zymoetz River (Station #08EF005). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EF005.png&quot;) Figure 2.8: Summary of hydrology statistics for Zymoetz River (Station #08EF005 - Lat 54.116829 Lon -127.426582). Available daily discharge data from 1997 to 2021. 2.3.4 Kispiox River The Kispiox River watershed is a seventh order stream that drains an area of 2,088km2 in a south east direction. It is a large tributary of the Skeena River, contributing approximately 9% of its flow. It flows 140km to the confluence of the Skeena River, located near Kispiox Village. Elevations in the watershed range from 200m at the mouth to as high as 2090m on Kispiox Mountain. The mainstream of the Kispiox is fed mainly by glacier melt and high elevation snow melt. Swan and Stephens Lakes (located in the upper watershed) are important sockeye systems. Swan Lake drains via Club Lake into Stephens Lake which in turn flows via Stephens Creek into the mainstem of the Kispiox River. Some of the biggest threats to aquatic ecosystems in the Kispiox valley are reported as erosion, obstructions, sedimentation, and altered water yield. The upper third of the Kispiox watershed (upstream of the Nangeese River) is well protected from develpment by the Swan Lake Kispiox River Provincial Park and because it contains few roads with little forestry development (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The Kispiox River has a mean annual discharge estimated at 45 m3/s at station 08EB004 located near Hazelton. Peak discharge happens in May and June as a result of the spring snowmelt (Figures 2.9 - 2.10). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08EB004.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) Figure 2.9: Hydrograph for Kispiox River near Hazelton (Station #08EB004). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08EB004.png&quot;) Figure 2.10: Summary of hydrology statistics for Kispiox River near Hazelton (Station #08EB004). Available daily discharge data from 1963 to 2021. 2.4 Fisheries In 2004, IBM Business Consulting Services (2006) estimated the value of Skeena Fisheries at an annual average of $110 million dollars. The Bulkley-Morice watershed is an integral part of the salmon production in the Skeena drainage and supports an internationally renown steelhead, chinook and coho sport fishery (Tamblyn 2005). 2.4.1 Bulkley River Traditionally, the salmon stocks passing through and spawning in Bulkley River were the principal food source for the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people living there (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) detail numerous fishing areas located within the lower Bulkley drainage (from the confluence of the Skeena to the confluence with the Telkwa River) and the upper Bulkley drainage which includes the mainstem Bulkley River and tributaries upstream of the Telkwa River confluence. Anadromous lamprey passing through and spawning in the upper Bulkley River were traditionally also an important food source for the Wet’suwet’en (Wilson and Rabnett 2007; pers comm. Mike Ridsdale, Environmental Assessment Coordinator, Office of the Wet’suwet’en). Approximately 11.3 km downstream of the Bulkley Lake outlet and just upstream of Watson Creek, the upper Bulkley falls is an approximately 4m high narrow rock sill that crosses the Bulkley River, producing a steep cascade section. This obstacle to fish passage is recorded as an almost complete barrier to fish passage for salmon during low water flows. Coho have not been observed beyond the falls since 1972 (Wilson and Rabnett 2007). Renowned as a world class recreational steelhead and coho fishery, the Bulkley River receives some of the heaviest angling pressure in the province. In response to longstanding angler concerns with respect to overcrowding, quality of experience and conflict amongst anglers, an Angling Management Plan was drafted for the river following the initiation of the Skeena Quality Waters Strategy process in 2006 and an extensive multi-year consultation process. The plan introduces a number of regulatory measures with the intent to provide Canadian resident anglers with quality steelhead fishing opportunities. Regulatory measures introduced with the Angling Management Plan include prohibited angling for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, Sept 1 - Oct 31 within the Bulkley River, angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens on Saturdays and Sundays, all year within the Suskwa River and angling prohibited for non-guided non-resident aliens Sept 1 - Oct 31 in the Telkwa River. The Bulkley River is considered Class II water and there is no fishing permitted upstream of the Morice/Bulkley River Confluence (FLNRO 2013a, 2013b; FLNRORD 2019). 2.4.2 Morice River Detailed reviews of Morice River watershed fisheries can be found in Bustard and Schell (2002), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002), Schell (2003), A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007), and ILMB (2007) with a comprehensive review of water quality by Oliver (2018). Overall, the Morice watershed contains high fisheries values as a major producer of chinook, pink, sockeye, coho and steelhead. 2.4.3 Zymoetz River Within the Zymoetz Watershed, there are many areas with high fishery values. Steelhead are the most extensively documented fish species in the Zymoetz River watershed. Adults enter the river from JUly to November and then go on to spawn the following year in late spring to early summer. The Zymoetz River is a relatively steep system. Two canyons are located 6.4 and 19.6 kilometers upstream of the Skeena River confluence. These canyons make access to the Zymoetz difficult for pink and chum salmon (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The Zymoetz River is renowned for its aggressive steelhead that have been known to take flies or lures. There is a 50km stretch upstream of Limonite Creek where the Zymoetz River is a designated Class I water. This section is remote and offers high quality fishing opportunities for anglers (FLNRORD 2013). Traditional First Nations use of the upper Zymoetz River watershed by the Gitxsan and Wet’suwet’en people differed between community sites, residences, and fish houses, and was large and diverse. From the upper to lower Zymoetz River and to the Skeena River, a significant ancient grease trail connected, with a branch track forking through Limonite Creek and flowing down the Telkwa River. The fishery used a weir at the mouth of McDonell Lake and spears at Six Mile Flats, near Dennis Lake. There is no information on native fisheries on the lower Zymoetz River. The Zymoetz is considered to be one of the top ten steelhead rivers in BC (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). 2.4.4 Kispiox River Kispiox River salmon are a important food source and cultural symbol for the Gitxsan people with sockeye and coho historically the two most significant species. Gitangwalk and Lax Didax, two significant villages that were both abandoned in the early 1900s, were situated on the Kispiox in such a way as to block the sockeye and coho salmon’s upstream migration to the Upper Kispiox River spawning grounds providing opportunities to gather and preserve a significant amount of high-quality food over relatively short time periods (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). The 100 km of mainstem and 300km of tributary streams in the Kispiox River Watershed are considering high value fish habitat supprting migration, spawning and rearing for many fish species. The Kispiox fisheries supports both recreational and commercial fishing while also enhancing the ecology, nutrient regime, and structural diversity of the drainage. Since 1992, sockeye and coho escapements from the Kispiox Watershed have been documented by the Gitxsan Watershed Authorities as they creates strong cultural, economic, and symbolic ties for the local communities (Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall 2002). 2.4.4.1 Fish Species Fish species recorded in the Bulkley River and Morice River watershed groups are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Coastal cutthrout trout and bull trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially. Summaries of some of the Skeena and Bulkley River fish species life history, biology, stock status, and traditional use are documented in Schell (2003), Wilson and Rabnett (2007), Allen Gottesfeld, Rabnett, and Hall (2002) and Office of the Wet’suwet’en (2013). Wilson and Rabnett (2007) discuss chinook, pink, sockeye, coho, steelhead and indigenous freshwater Bulkley River fish stocks within the context of key lower and upper Bulkley River habitats such as the Suskwa River, Station Creek, Harold Price Creek, Telkwa River and Buck Creek. Key areas within the upper Bulkley River watershed with high fishery values, documented in Schell (2003), are the upper Bulkley mainstem, Buck Creek, Dungate Creek, Barren Creek, McQuarrie Creek, Byman Creek, Richfield Creek, Johnny David Creek, Aitken Creek and Emerson Creek. Some key areas of high fisheries values for chinook, sockeye and coho are noted in Bustard and Schell (2002) as McBride Lake, Nanika Lake, and Morice Lake watersheds. A draft gantt chart for select species in the Morice River and Bulkley River watersheds was derived from reviews of the aforementioned references and is included as Figure 2.11. The data is considered in draft form and will be refined over the spring and summer of 2021 with local fisheries technicians and knowledge holders during the collaboratory assessment planning and fieldwork activities planned. In the 1990’s the Morice River watershed, A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007) estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in A. Gottesfeld and Rabnett (2007). Coho spawn in major tributaries and small streams ideally at locations where downstream dispersal can result in seeding of prime off channel habitats including warm productive sloughs and side channels. Of all the salmon species, coho rely on small tributaries the most (Bustard and Schell 2002). Bustard and Schell (2002) report that much of the distribution of coho into non-natal tributaries occurs during high flow periods of May - early July with road culverts blocking migration into these habitats. ##### Chinook # In the 1990&#39;s Morice River watershed, @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish estimated that chinook comprised 30% of the total Skeena system chinook escapements. @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have recorded juvenile chinook rearing in small non natal streams. # @buckwalter_kirsch2012Fishinventory have uvenile chinook have been recorded rearing in small non natal streams #It is estimated that Morice River coho comprise approximatley 4% of the Skeena escapement with a declining trend noted since the 1950 in @gottesfeld_rabnett2007SkeenaFish.

A Fish Passage Technical Working Group has been formed to coordinate the protocol and data is continuously amalgamated within the Provincial Steam Crossing Inventory System (PSCIS). The strategic approach protocol involves a four-phase process as described in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2014) : Phase 1: Fish Passage Assessment – Fish stream crossings within watersheds with high fish values are assessed to determine barrier status of structures and document a general assessment of adjacent habitat quality and quantity. Phase 2: Habitat Confirmation – Assessments of crossings prioritized for follow up in Phase 1 studies are conducted to confirm quality and quantity of habitat upstream and down as well as to scope for other potential nearby barriers that could affect the practicality of remediation. Phase 3: Design – Site plans and designs are drawn for priority crossings where high value fish habitat has been confirmed. Phase 4: Remediation – Re-connection of isolated habitats through replacement, rehabilitation or removal of prioritized crossing structure barriers. 2.5.1 Bulkley River There is a rich history of fish passage restoration planning in the Bulkley River watershed group with not all the work documented in the PSCIS system. A non-exhaustive list of historic fish passage reports for the watershed includes Wilson and Rabnett (2007), McCarthy and Fernando (2015),Smith (2018) Casselman and Stanley (2010) and Irvine (2018). Review of the PSCIS database indicated that prior to 2021, 1665 assessments for fish passage (Phase 1) at crossing structures within the Bulkley River watershed group have been recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021a). No habitat confirmations are recorded in the PSCIS database (MoE 2021b). Within the Bulkley River watershed group, a number of remediation projects have been completed over the years with backwatering works conducted on Toboggan Creek, Coffin Creek, Moan Creek, Johnny David Creek and potentially others. Three culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS and include works on Barren Creek as well as two tributaries to Harold Prince Creek (MoE 2021c). McDowell Creek at Highway 16 was replaced with a horizontally drilled baffled structure in 2017 and a design is currently being drafted for the Highway 16 crossing over Taman Creek (pers. comm.

Two culvert replacements (with open bottom structures) in the watershed group have been tracked in PSCIS in the and include works on a tributary to the Morice River located at km 39.2 of the Morice River FSR and on bridge installation at km 4 of McBride Road on a tributary to McBride Lake (MoE 2021c). ##`r pscis_historic_phase1 %&gt;% filter(watershed_group_code %ilike% &#39;MORR&#39; &amp; assessment_date &lt; &#39;2020-01-01&#39;) %&gt;% nrow()` "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Planning 3.2 Fish Passage Assessments 3.3 Habitat Confirmation Assessments 3.4 Reporting 3.5 Mapping", " 3 Methods Workflows for the project have been classified into planning, fish passage assessments, habitat confirmation assessments, reporting and mapping. All components leveraged R, SQL or Python programming languages to facilitate workflow tracking, collaboration, transparency and continually improving research. Project workflows utilized local and remote postgreSQL databases as well as a “snapshot” of select datasets contained within a local sqlite database. A data and script repository to facilitate this reporting is located on Github. source(&#39;scripts/packages.R&#39;) source(&#39;scripts/tables.R&#39;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) 3.1 Planning To identify priorities for crossing structure rehabilitation, background literature, fisheries information, PSCIS, and bcfishpass (Norris 2021d) outputs were reviewed. bcfishpass is an updated open-source code repository comprised of tools ported over from the Fish Habitat Model (Norris and Mount 2016) developed by the BC Ministry of Environment along with a number of significant upgrades and new features. Scripts within bcfishpass also pull and analyze data using other open-source tools such as bcdata (Norris 2021b), bcfishobs (Norris 2021c), and fwapg (Norris 2021a) which serve numerous functions related to open-data access as well as the analysis of the BC Freshwater Atlas, roads, fish and fish habitat in British Columbia. 3.1.1 Habitat Modelling bcfishpass calculates the average gradient of BC Freshwater Atlas stream network lines at minimum 100m long intervals starting from the downstream end of the streamline segment and working upstream. The network lines are broken into max gradient categories with new segments created if and when the average slope of the stream line segment exceeds user provided thresholds. For this project, the user provided gradient thresholds used to delineate “potentially accessible habitat” were based on estimated max gradients that salmon (15% - coho and chinook) and steelhead (20%) are likely to be capable of ascending. Through this initiative and other SERN/New Graph led initiatives, the Provincial Fish Passage Remediation Program and connectivity restoration planning by the Canadian Wildlife Federation (Mazany-Wright et al. 2021), bcfishpass has been designed to prioritize potential fish passage barriers for assessment or remediation. The software is under continual development and has been designed and constructed by Norris (2021d) using sql and python based shell script libraries to generate a simple model of aquatic habitat connectivity. The model identifies natural barriers (ex. steep gradients for extended distances) and hydroelectric dams to classifying the accessibility upstream by fish (Norris 2021d). On potentially accessible streams, scripts identify known barriers (ex. waterfalls &gt;5m high) and additional anthropogenic features which are primarily road/railway stream crossings (i.e. culverts) that are potentially barriers. To prioritize these features for assessment or remediation, scripts report on how much modelled potentially accessible aquatic habitat the barriers may obstruct. The model can be refined with known fish observations upstream of identified barriers and for each crossing location, the area of lake and wetland habitat upstream, species documented upstream/downstream, an estimate of watershed area (on 2nd order and higher streams), mean annual precipitation weighted to upstream watershed area and channel width can be collated using bcfishpass, fwapg and bcfishobs. This, information, can be used to provides an indication of the potential quantity and quality of habitat potentially gained should fish passage be restored by comparing to user defined thresholds for the aforementioned parameters. A discussion of the methodology to derive channel width is below. Gradient, channel size and stream discharge are key determinants of channel morphology and subsequently fish distribution. High value rearing, overwintering and spawning habitat preferred by numerous species/life stages of fish are often located within channel types that have relatively low gradients and large channel widths (also quantified by the amount of flow in the stream). Following delineation of “potentially accessible habitat”, the average gradient of each stream segment within habitat classified as below the 15% and 20% thresholds was calculated and summed within species and life stage specific gradient categories. Average gradient of stream line segments can be calculated from elevations contained in the provincial freshwater atlas streamline dataset. To obtain estimates of channel width upstream of crossing locations, Where available, bcfishpass was utilized to pull average channel gradients from Fisheries Information Summary System (FISS) site assessment data (MoE 2020d) or PSCIS assessment data (MoE 2021a) and associate with stream segment lines. When both FISS and PSCIS values were associated with a particular stream segment, FISS channel width was used. When multiple FISS sites were associated with a particular stream segment a mean of the average channel widths was taken. To model channel width for 2nd order and above stream segments without associated FISS or PSCIS sites, first fwapg was used to estimate the drainage area upstream of the segment. Then, rasters from ClimateBC (Wang et al. 2012) were sampled for each stream segments and a mean annual precipitation weighted by upstream watershed area was calculated. Mean annual precipitation was then combined with the channel widths and BEC zone information (gathered through a spatial query tied to the bottom of the stream segment) into a dataset (n = 22990) for analysis fo the relationship between these variables. The details of this analysis and resulting formula used to estimate channel width on stream segments in the Skeena Watershed is included as a technical appendix here. bcfishpass and associated tools have been designed to be flexible in analysis, accepting user defined gradient, channel width and stream discharge categories (MoE 2020d). Although currently in draft form, and subject to development revisions, gradient and channel width thresholds for habitat with the highest intrinsic value for a number of fish species in the Bulkley River watershed group have been specified and applied to model habitat upstream of stream crossing locations with the highest intrinsic value (Table 3.1). Thresholds were derived based on a literature review with references provided in Table 3.2. Output parameters for modelling are presented in Table 3.3. #`r if(identical(gitbook_on, FALSE)){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)}` bcfishpass_spawn_rear_model %&gt;% mutate(Species = fishbc::fbc_common_name(species_code), spawn_gradient_max = round(spawn_gradient_max * 100 ,1), rear_gradient_max = round(rear_gradient_max * 100 ,1)) %&gt;% select(Species, `Spawning Gradient Max (%)`= spawn_gradient_max, `Spawning Width Min (m)` = spawn_channel_width_min, # `Spawning Width Max (m)` = spawn_channel_width_max, # `Spawning MAD Min (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_min, # `Spawning MAD Max (m3/s)` = spawn_mad_max, `Rearing Gradient Max (%)` = rear_gradient_max, `Rearing Width Min (m)` = rear_channel_width_min) %&gt;% # `Rearing MAD Min (m3/s)` = rear_mad_min, # `Rearing MAD Max (m3/s)` = rear_mad_max, # `Rearing Wetland Multiplier` = rear_wetland_multiplier, # `Rearing Lake Multiplier` = rear_lake_multiplier) %&gt;% t() %&gt;% as_tibble(rownames = &quot;row_names&quot;) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) %&gt;% rename(Variable = Species) %&gt;% select(-`Westslope Cutthroat Trout`, -`Arctic Grayling`, -`Kokanee`, -`Bull Trout`, -`Rainbow Trout`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.1: Stream gradient and channel width thresholds used to model potentially highest value fish habitat.

Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.4). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. fpr_table_habvalue %&gt;% knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.4: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).

Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.2.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011a). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.5, Table 3.6. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% mutate(V4 = names(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% select(V4, everything()) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(1) %&gt;% ##turn the table sideways mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.5: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

Cumlative Score Result 0-14 passable 15-19 potential barrier &gt;20 barrier 3.2.2 Cost Benefit Analysis A cost benefit analysis was conducted for each crossing determined to be a barrier based on an estimate of cost associated with remediation or replacement of the crossing with a structure that facilitates fish passage and the amount of potential habitat that would be made available by remediating fish passage at the site (habitat gain index). 3.2.2.1 Habitat Gain Index The habitat gain index is the quantity of modelled habitat upstream of the subject crossing and represents an estimate of habitat gained with remediation of fish passage at the crossing. For this project, a gradient threshold between accessible and non-accessible habitat was set at 20% (for a minimimum length of 100m) intended to represent the maximum gradient of which the strongest swimmers of anadromous species (steelhead) are likely to be able to migrate upstream. For reporting of Phase 1 - fish passage assessments within the body of this report (Table 3.5), a “total” value of habitat &lt;20% output from bcfishpass was used to estimate the amount of habitat upstream of each crossing less than 20% gradient before a falls of height &gt;5m - as recorded in MoE (2020c) or documented in other bcfishpass online documentation. For Phase 2 - habitat confirmation sites, conservative estimates of the linear quantity of habitat to be potentially gained by fish passage restoration, steelhead rearing maximum gradient threshold (7.4%) was used. To generate areas of habitat upstream, the estimated linear length was multiplied by half the downstream channel width measured (overall triangular channel shape) as part of the fish passage assessment protocol. Although these estimates are not generally conservative, have low accuracy and do not account for upstream stream crossing structures they allow a rough idea of the best candidates for follow up. Potential options to remediate fish passage were selected from MoE (2011a) and included: Removal (RM) - Complete removal of the structure and deactivation of the road. Open Bottom Structure (OBS) - Replacement of the culvert with a bridge or other open bottom structure. Based on consultation with FLNR road crossing engineering experts, for this project we considered bridges as the only viable option for OBS type . Streambed Simulation (SS) - Replacement of the structure with a streambed simulation design culvert. Often achieved by embedding the culvert by 40% or more. Based on consultation with FLNR engineering experts, we considered crossings on streams with a channel width of &lt;2m and a stream gradient of &lt;8% as candidates for replacement with streambed simulations. Additional Substrate Material (EM) - Add additional substrate to the culvert and/or downstream weir to embed culvert and reduce overall velocity/turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop = 0, culvert slope &lt;1.0% and stream width ratio &lt; 1.0. Backwater (BW) - Backwatering of the structure to reduce velocity and turbulence. This option was considered only when outlet drop &lt; 0.3m, culvert slope &lt;2.0%, stream width ratio &lt; 1.2 and stream profiling indicates it would be effective.. Cost estimates for structure replacement with bridges and embedded culverts were generated based on the channel width, slope of the culvert, depth of fill, road class and road surface type. Road details were sourced from FLNRORD (2020b) and FLNRORD (2020a) through bcfishpass. Interviews with Phil MacDonald, Engineering Specialist FLNR - Kootenay, Steve Page, Area Engineer - FLNR - Northern Engineering Group and Matt Hawkins - MoTi - Design Supervisor for Highway Design and Survey - Nelson were utilized to helped refine estimates. Base costs for installation of bridges on forest service roads and permit roads with surfaces specified in provincial GIS road layers as rough and loose was estimated at $12500/linear m and assumed that the road could be closed during construction and a minimum bridge span of 10m. For streams with channel widths &lt;2m, embedded culverts were reported as an effective solution with total installation costs estimated at $25k/crossing (pers. comm. Phil MacDonald, Steve Page). For larger streams (&gt;6m), span width increased proportionally to the size of the stream (ex. for an 8m wide stream a 12m wide span was prescribed). For crossings with large amounts of fill (&gt;3m), the replacement bridge span was increased by an additional 3m for each 1m of fill &gt;3m to account for cutslopes to the stream at a 1.5:1 ratio. To account for road type, a multiplier table was also generated to estimate incremental cost increases with costs estimated for structure replacement on paved surfaces, railways and arterial/highways costing up to 20 times more than forest service roads due to expenses associate with design/engineering requirements, traffic control and paving. The cost multiplier table (Table ??) should be considered very approximate with refinement recommended for future projects. # print_tab_cost_mult(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;) tab_cost_rd_mult_report %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Cost multiplier table based on road class and surface type.&#39;, scroll = F) 3.3 Habitat Confirmation Assessments Following fish passage assessments, habitat confirmations were completed in accordance with procedures outlined in the document “A Checklist for Fish Habitat Confirmation Prior to the Rehabilitation of a Stream Crossing” (Fish Passage Technical Working Group 2011). The main objective of the field surveys was to document upstream habitat quantity and quality and to determine if any other obstructions exist above or below the crossing. Habitat value was assessed based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation. Criteria used to rank habitat value was based on guidelines in Fish Passage Technical Working Group (2011) (Table 3.4). During habitat confirmations, to standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on “Site Cards”. Habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. Fish sampling was conducted on a subset of sites when biological data was considered to add significant value to the physical habitat assessment information. When possible, electrofishing was utilized within discrete site units both upstream and downstream of the subject crossing with electrofisher settings, water quality parameters (i.e. conductivity, temperature and ph), start location, length of site and wetted widths (average of a minimum of three) recorded. For each fish captured, fork length and species was recorded, with results included within the fish data submission spreadsheet. Fish information and habitat data will be submitted to the province under scientific fish collection permit CB20-611971. 3.4 Reporting Reporting was generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2023) with primarily R (R Core Team 2022) and SQL scripts. The R package fpr contains many specialized custom functions related to the work (Irvine [2022] 2022). In addition to numerous spatial layers sourced through the BC Data Catalogue then stored and queried in a local postgresql and sqlite databases data inputs for this project include: Populated Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 Populated pscis_assessment_template_v24.xls bcfishpass outputs.

Photos and photo metadata Version changes are tracked here and issues/planned enhancements tracked here. 3.5 Mapping Mapping was completed by Hillcrest Geographics. pdf maps were generated using QGIS with data supplied via a postgreSQL database. A QGIS layer file defining and symbolizing all layers required for general fish passage mapping was developed and at the time of reporting was kept under version control within bcfishpass.

A total of 61 Phase 1 assessments at sites not yet inventoried into the PSCIS system included 18 crossings considered “passable”, 7 crossings considered “potential” barriers and 32 crossings considered “barriers” according to threshold values based on culvert embedment, outlet drop, slope, diameter (relative to channel size) and length (MoE 2011a). Additionally, although all were considered fully passable, 4 crossings assessed were fords and ranked as “unknown” according to the provincial protocol. Georeferenced field maps are presented here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. A summary of crossings assessed, a cost estimate for remediation and a priority ranking for follow up for Phase 1 sites is presented in Table ??. Detailed data with photos are presented in Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos. “Barrier” and “Potential Barrier” rankings used in this project followed MoE (2011a) and reflect an assessment of passability for juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout at any flows potentially present throughout the year (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). As noted in Bourne et al. (2011), with a detailed review of different criteria in Kemp and O’Hanley (2010), passability of barriers can be quantified in many different ways. Fish physiology (i.e. species, length, swim speeds) can make defining passability complex but with important implications for evaluating connectivity and prioritizing remediation candidates (Bourne et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2016; Mahlum et al. 2014; Kemp and O’Hanley 2010). Washington Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife (2009) present criteria for assigning passability scores to culverts that have already been assessed as barriers in coarser level assessments. These passability scores provide additional information to feed into decision making processes related to the prioritization of remediation site candidates and have potential for application in British Columbia. tab_cost_est_phase1 %&gt;% select(`PSCIS ID`:`Cost Est ( $K)`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Upstream habitat estimates and cost benefit analysis for Phase 1 assessments conducted on sites not yet inventoried in PSCIS.

A total of approximately 7km of stream was assessed, fish sampling utilizing electrofishing surveys were conducted at two streams. Georeferenced field maps are presented in here and available for bulk download as Attachment 1. As collaborative decision making was ongoing at the time of reporting, site prioritization can be considered preliminary. In total, 6 crossings were rated as high priorities for proceeding to design for replacement, 2 crossings were rated as moderate priorities, and 0 crossings were rated as low priorities. Results are summarized in Figure 4.1 and Tables 4.1 - 4.4 with raw habitat and fish sampling data included in digital format as Attachment 3.

Designs for McDowell and Robert Hatch were procured by SERNbc and Canadian Wildlife Federation respectively. At the time of reporting, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, in collaboration with Canadian Wildlife Federation was in the process of procuring designs for remediation of fish passage at three sites documented in Irvine (2021) including PSCIS 123445 on Tyhee Creek, PSCIS 124500 on Helps Creek and PSCIS 197640 on a tributary to Buck Creek. Additionally, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure were procuring a design for PSCIS crossing 124420 on Station Creek (also know as Mission Creek) near New Hazleton (pers. comm. Sean Wong, Environmental Programs, MoTi). "],["recommendations.html", "5 Recommendations", " 5 Recommendations Recommendations for potential incorporation into collaborative watershed connectivity planning include: Continue to acquire background information and leverage ongoing research initiatives in the region to collaboratively clarify current conditions and identify limiting factors to inform prioritization and effectiveness monitoring programs. Develop strategies to explore cost and fisheries production benefits of stream crossing structure upgrades alongside alternative/additional restoration and enhancement investments such as land conservation/procurement/covenant, cattle exclusion, riparian restoration, habitat complexing, water conservation, commercial/recreational fishing management, water treatment and research. Ideentify and pursue opportunities to collaborate and leverage initiatives together in study area watersheds (ex. fish passage rehabilitation, riparian restoration and cattle exclusion) for maximum likely restoration benefits. Refine barrier thresholds for road-stream crossing structures to explore metrics specific to life stage and life history types of species of interest. This will further focus efforts of potential remediation actions based on biological attributes (ex. timing of migration, size/direction of fish migrating, population dynamics, etc.) and could result in the consideration of interim “stop-gap” physical works to alter crossing characteristics that can address key connectivity issues yet be significantly less costly than structure replacements (ex. building up of downstream area with rock riffles to decrease the outlet drop size and/or increasing water depth within pipe with baffles and substrate additions). Model fish densities (fish/m2) vs. habitat/water quality characteristics (i.e. gradient, discharge, alkalinity, elevation, riparian health, distance from high order streams, etc.) using historically gathered electrofishing and remotely sensed geodata to inform crossing prioritization, future data acquisition needs and the monitoring of restoration actions. Continue to develop bcfishpass,bcfishobs, fwapg, bcdata and fpr as well as to share open source data analysis and presentation tools that are scaleable and facilitate continual improvement. Tools should continue to be flexible and well documented to allow the future incorporation of alternative fragmentation indicators, habitat gain/value metrics and watershed sensitivity indicators. Continue to collaborate with potential partners to build relationships, explore perspectives and develop “road maps” for aquatic restoration in different situations (MoT roads, rail lines, permit roads of different usages, FSRs, etc.) – documenting the people involved, discussions and processes that are undertaken, funding options, synergies, measures of success, etc. "],["appendix---phase-1-fish-passage-assessment-data-and-photos.html", "Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos", " Appendix - Phase 1 Fish Passage Assessment Data and Photos Location and Stream Data Crossing Characteristics – Date 2022-09-05 Crossing Sub Type Ford PSCIS ID 198180 Diameter (m) – External ID 8301039 Length (m) – Crew MW Embedded – UTM Zone 9 Depth Embedded (m) – Easting 567730 Resemble Channel – Northing 6152762 Backwatered – Stream Tributary to Kispiox River Percent Backwatered – Road Helen 900 FSR Fill Depth (m) – Road Tenure BCTS 8243 Outlet Drop (m) – Channel Width (m) – Outlet Pool Depth (m) – Stream Slope (%) – Inlet Drop – Beaver Activity No Slope (%) – Habitat Value – Valley Fill – Final score 0 Barrier Result Unknown Fix type – Fix Span / Diameter – Photos: PSCIS ID 198180.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 197379 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.3). The crossing had a significant outlet drop of 0.47m. Water temperature was 12\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 7.9 and conductivity was 249uS/cm. fpr::fpr_table_cv_summary_memo() Table 5.3: Summary of fish passage assessment for PSCIS crossing 197379.

The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with overhanging vegetation dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris and undercut banks.The average channel width was 4.3m, the average wetted width was 2.6m, and the average gradient was 3.3%. The stream had signs of high flow due to the eroded steep sided banks. However, there was still a nice mix of habitat available including periodic undercut banks and lots of overhanging vegetation. Gradient was relatively stable at 4 degrees although there were some woody debris jams which could impede upstream migration, depending on flows. One fish sighted was sighted in the outlet pool. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 197379 for 800m to a waterfall that was approximately 8m in height (Figures 5.4 - 5.7). The average channel width was 6.4m, the average wetted width was 3.1m, and the average gradient was 4.8%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with undercut banks dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. Bedrock dominated the stream substrate. There were abundant undercut banks present with some pools. Healthy riparian vegetation providing cover. Functional woody debris habitat with good flow. There was a large woody debris jam but there was running water underneath. The stream was steep below the falls with a measured gradient of 7%. The habitat was rated as high value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted in 2022 with results summarised in Tables 5.5 - 5.6 and Figure 5.1. Coho were captured downstream of the crossings but not upstream. There appeared to be some rainbow and cutthroat hybrids. The stream was mostly dry at the time of electrofishing, with fish concentrated in pools. Captured fish were tagged, data can be found in the habitat confirmation excel sheet here. Conclusion There was 0.8km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 197379 with areas surveyed rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 197379 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. A engineering design for a replacement structure that will more effectively facilitate upstream migration for all fish life stages and species is being carried out by Mark Dewit from the Northern Engineering Group. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.4: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 197379.

Stream Characteristics at Crossing At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing 198215 was un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a barrier barrier to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b) (Table 5.9). There was two culverts side by side, but one was not functioning and had debris blocking the outlet. There was low flow through the functioning culvert at the time of survey. The outlet drop was significant at 1.1m.

The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.The average channel width was 5.3m, the average wetted width was 2.1m, and the average gradient was 11%.Total cover amount was rated as trace with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris and overhanging vegetation. This stretch of stream was steep but had good habitat. There was one lock block step approximately 30m downstream of the culvert that was approximately 1m in height that could block upstream migration for non adult fish species (Figure 5.9). This was likely put in this location in the past to act as a backwatering structure and attempt to minimize the culvert outlet drop to facilitate upstream fish passage. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198215 for 800m (Figures 5.10 - 5.13). Total cover amount was rated as moderate with large woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, boulders, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation.The average channel width was 3.8m, the average wetted width was 2.3m, and the average gradient was 7%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant. There were numerous cascades that were approximately 1m in height at the time of survey, with deep outlet pools. The stream was wide throughout. A lot of large woody debris was found in and around the stream. There were trace areas with gravels that could be suitable for spawning. After the first 500m of the survey, there were logs deliberately placed perpendicular to the stream at regular intervals (shown in Figure 5.13). These most likely function to capture substrate, provide complexity and spawning/rearing habitat. The habitat was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Conclusion There was 0km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 198215 with areas surveyed rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. 198215 was ranked as a moderate priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Electrofishing upstream and downstream of the culvert is recommended to provide insight into fish community composition and density which may justify a higher priority for site remediation. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% # select(-Site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.10: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 198215.

The site is located on Hwy 37. Crossing 198220 was located 0.8km upstream from the confluence with the Kitwanga River. A modelled crossing located approximately 200m upstream was also assessed and is discussed below. Background At crossing 198220, Tea Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 52.2km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1141m to 229m near the crossing (Table 5.11).

The weir structure included seven weirs and was designed to reduce the outlet drop and facilitate upstream fish passage migration. Instead of using rock, notched pre-cast concrete lock blocks were utilised to make the plunge pools. To prevent streambed scour, the outlet was armored with riprap. A bottomless pipe arch was installed in 1998 at the Moore Road crossing, at a 3% gradient (Sweeting, n.d.). PSCIS stream crossing 198220 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC due to the large size of the stream, with many species confirmed upstream.

The culvert was considered a complete barrier to all species and all life stages at all flows due to an outlet drop measured at 0.45m high. The deep and large outlet pool indicated that the culvert was significantly undersized. Condition of the pipe was noted as poor with extensive corrosion present and some collapsing in the middle of the pipe.

The average channel width was 8.1m, the average wetted width was NAm, and the average gradient was 4.5%.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant.Total cover amount was rated as trace with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as undercut banks. The habitat was rated as NA value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 198222 for 650m (Figures 5.22 - 5.25). The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub-dominant.The average channel width was 13.1m, the average wetted width was NAm, and the average gradient was 3.6%.Total cover amount was rated as trace with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as undercut banks. There was a large woody debris jam 1.3m in height located approximately 500m upstream of the crossing. This obstacle would be passable for adult salmonids but dependent on flow conditions it is likely a fish passage issue for the upstream migration of all life stages of resident populations as well as non-adult salmonids. This is a high energy system with numerous areas of multiple channel, islands and elevated bars. High flows were pushing most large woody debris out of the main channel resulting in lower complexity and most cover was available as boulders. There were rare pockets of gravel suitable for spawning. Overall, the habitat surveyed upstream of the crossing was rated as medium value as an important migration corridor containing habitat suitable for spawning with moderate rearing potential. Fish Sampling To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, minnowtrapping was conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing. A total of 1 fish were captured upstream with 6 fish captured downstream. Only Dolly Varden were captured. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Conclusion Modelling indicates 3.9km of habitat upstream of crossing 198222 suitable for steelhead rearing with areas surveyed rated as medium value for rearing and spawning.

PSCIS crossing 8530 is located on Mcdonell FSR. Crossing 8530 was located 0km upstream from the confluence with the Zymoetz River and is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Background At crossing 8530, Sandstone Creek is a second order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 1.9km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1086m to 814m at the crossing (Table 5.28).

The mainstem is 9.8km in length and is fed by 13 tributaries. A total of 0ha of lake and 0ha of wetland is modelled upstream. Sandstone Lake is located approximately 4km upstream of crossing 8530, and has an area of 67ha. According to historical records, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout have been known to reside in Sandstone Lake. (Ltd. 1998) fished two sites in 1996 located before the lake on the mainstem and caught cutthroat trout. Rainbow trout were caught upstream of Sandstone Lake and cutthroat trout were caught in a tributary located approximately 800m upstream of crossing 8530 in 1997. PSCIS stream crossing 8530 was ranked as a high priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC because of significant amounts of habitat modelled upstream of the crossing. (Viveiros 2011) assessed crossing 8530 in 2010. At the time of survey, it was recommended to embed the material in the pipe due to its size to reduce water velocity.

The dominant substrate was large rock/bedrock with cobbles sub-dominant.The average channel width was 4m, the average wetted width was 3.2m, and the average gradient was 2.8%.Total cover amount was rated as abundant with boulders dominant. Cover was also present as small woody debris, large woody debris, undercut banks, deep pools, and overhanging vegetation. There was good flow at the time of survey. Riparian vegetation was healthy, providing plenty of shade and cover. There were small packets of gravel suitable for spawning. Features such as large woody debris jams and cascades were present that could act as a natural barrier to fish passage, although during high flow there’s a good chance strong fish can make it up. Plenty of pools were available for fish rearing. Functional large and small woody debris as well as boulders were present and add complexity into the stream. Stream was confined in a bed rock canyon, with overhanging vegetation and shrubs taking up about 2 m on either side of the bank. The habitat was rated as medium value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed upstream from crossing 8530 for 600m (Figures 5.41 - 5.44). The average channel width was 3.8m, the average wetted width was 2.3m, and the average gradient was 3.2%.Total cover amount was rated as moderate with small woody debris dominant. Cover was also present as large woody debris, undercut banks, and overhanging vegetation.The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub-dominant. There was abundant cover from woody debris, overhanging veg and undercut banks at the time of survey. The channel was wide throughout with graveled areas suitable for spawning. There was trace distribution of deep pools suitable for rearing. A couple smaller cascades (&lt;1m in height) were present that may block smaller fish. The habitat was rated as high value as an important migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having moderate rearing potential. Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables 5.32 - 5.33 and Figure 5.38. Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate Conclusion There was 0km of habitat modelled upstream of crossing 8530 with areas surveyed rated as high value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing 8530 was ranked as a high priority for proceeding to design for replacement. Sandstone Creek is a large system with habitat suitable for numerous species including cutthroat and dolly varden. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with a bridge would be a key step in eliminating an outlet drop and reducing flow velocities at the highway crossing. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site == my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 5.31: Summary of habitat details for PSCIS crossing 8530.
