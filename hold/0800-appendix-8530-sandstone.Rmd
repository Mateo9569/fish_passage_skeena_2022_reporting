## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 9km south of the town of
Witset, BC. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was located
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Bulkley River and is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-58067)). Upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously
been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-58067, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  select(-'Elev Min') %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

<br>

In a study conducted by [@porter2015], the Gramophone Creek stream
network was analysed using GIS methods to assess the risk status related
to fish habitat impact. The Gramophone Creek watershed is designated as
a Fisheries Sensitive Watershed (FSW) under British Columbia's Forest
and Range Practices Act Government Actions Regulation, and the Oil and
Gas Activities Act Environmental Management and Protection Regulation.
FSW's have significant fish values and are sensitive to changes in
habitat. Risk status was determined by measuring nine habitat
indicators. These included: road density for the entire watershed, road
density above the H~60~ line (the elevation above which 60% of the
watershed area lies), road density less than 100m from a stream, stream
crossing density, proportion of stream logged, proportion of
fish-bearing stream logged, density of stream banks logged on slopes
greater than 60%, peak flow index, and road density on unstable slopes.
Measured values were compared to a baseline to classify risk as low,
moderate, or high. Of the 71 watersheds included in the analysis,
Gramophone Creek was notable for having all nine indicators rated as
high risk.

<br>

The Trout Creek/Moricetown watershed project was an integrated
restoration plan designed for 14 watersheds found on either side of the
Bulkley River. Gramophone Creek was included in the study area. A level
I sediment source assessment was conducted on the watershed. This
provided an overview and a risk assessment of sedimentation in pre
defined study blocks, which was then used to recommend further
restoration strategies. The risk assessment was used to determine if the
roads were on low, moderate, or high-risk terrain; and the consequence
that sedimentation could have on the road's associated fisheries stream.
Gramophone Creek scored lower than average overall on the risk
assessment but had some study blocks that required a level II assessment
[@sterlingwoodgroupinc_1997TroutCreek].

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high
priority for follow up by the Canadian Wildlife Federation because of
significant amounts of habitat modelled upstream of the crossing. Upon
review of an assessment done on this crossing in 2012 by @gollner2013, @irvine2018AnalysisPriority ranked it as a high priority for follow up due to its high habitat value. A summary of
habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-58067). A map of the watershed is provided in
map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-58067)). The crossing consisted of two
pipes, with a very big outlet pool. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')` to the confluence with the
Bulkley River
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There were abundant undercut
banks available for cover. Some patches of gravel were present that
would be suitable for rainbow, steelhead and coho spawning. Occasional
deep pools were present that would serve as good habitat suitable for
fish rearing and overwintering. The riparian vegetation was an old
growth mixed forest. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for salmonid rearing and
spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-58067-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There is a small beaver dam
\~500m upstream from the crossing. Some areas are coupled with
embankment issues. The stream is wide throughout with abundant cover and
some areas with gravels suitable for spawning. There is approximately
50m of open residential area on the right bank. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables
\@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-58067) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-58067) and
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-58067).

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. Tributary to Gramophone Creek is a
large system with habitat suitable for numerous species including coho
and steelhead salmon. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with
a bridge would be a key step in eliminating an outlet drop and reducing
flow velocities at the highway crossing.
