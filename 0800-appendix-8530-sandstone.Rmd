## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` approximately 5km west of the town of
Smithers. PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)`. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was located
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Zymoetz River and is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-8530)). Upstream of crossing
`r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have previously
been recorded [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2020bcfishobs].

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-8530, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  select(-'Elev Min') %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

[@tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd.1998] conducted a reconnaissance
level fish and fish habitat inventory on Sandstone Creek. The mainstem
is 9.8km in length and is fed by 13 tributaries. A total of
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_lakereservoir_ha)`ha of lake
and `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = total_wetland_ha)`ha of wetland
is modelled upstream. Sandstone Lake is located approximately 4km
upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, and has an area of 67ha.
According to historical records, Dolly Varden and cutthroat trout have
been known to reside in Sandstone Lake.
[@tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd.1998] fished two sites in 1996
located before the lake on the mainstem and caught cutthroat trout.
Rainbow trout were caught upstream of Sandstone Lake and cutthroat trout
were caught in a tributary located approximately 800m upstream of
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` in 1997.

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high
priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC because of
significant amounts of habitat modelled upstream of the crossing. [@viveiros2011] assessed crossing `r as.character(my_site)` in 2010. At the time of survey, it was recommended to embed the material in the pipe due to its size to reduce water velocity. A summary of habitat modelling outputs is
presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-8530). A map of the
watershed is provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet()).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)` to upstream fish
passage according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment]
(Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-8530)). Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr::fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-8530-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-8530-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8530-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` There was good flow at the time
of survey. Riparian vegetation was healthy, providing plenty of shade
and cover. There were small packets of gravel suitable for spawning.
Features such as large woody debris jams and cascades were present that
could act as a natural barrier to fish passage, although during high
flow there's a good chance strong fish can make it up. Plenty of pools
were available for fish rearing. Functional large and small woody debris
as well as boulders were present and add complexity into the stream.
Stream was confined in a bed rock canyon, with overhanging vegetation
and shrubs taking up about 2 m on either side of the bank. The habitat
was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-8530-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-8530-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-8530-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There was abundant cover from
woody debris, overhanging veg and undercut banks at the time of survey.
The channel was wide throughout with graveled areas suitable for
spawning. There was trace distribution of deep pools suitable for
rearing. A couple smaller cascades (\<1m in height) were present that
may block smaller fish. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential.

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted with results summarised in Tables
\@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-8530) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-8530) and Figure
\@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-8530).

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for salmonid rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement. Sandstone Creek is a large system
with habitat suitable for numerous species including cutthroat and dolly
varden. Development of a plan to replace the crossing with a bridge
would be a key step in eliminating an outlet drop and reducing flow
velocities at the highway crossing.
