## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and `r as.character(my_site2)`
are located on a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, just outside the small
community of Sik-E-Dakh (Glen Vowell). Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is
located `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = my_site, col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Skeena River on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Transportation and Infrastructure. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site2)` is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)` 300m upstream from `r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` and is under the jurisdiction of Sik-E-Dakh.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

Located on the west side of the Skeena River, between Hazelton and Kispiox, Sik-E-Dakh is a Gitxsan community home to the Glen Vowell Band. "Sik-E-Dakh" means "Bright Lights Behind Mountain" [@SikEDakhGlenVowellBand2023]. The subject stream supplies drinking water to the community with drinking water storage and treatment infrastructure located on `r fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = road_name)` beyond the location of `r as.character(my_site2)`. The underlying territory of this stream is within the Wilps Antgililibixw reserve boundary. 

<br>

Approximately 300m north of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` on Kispiox Valley Road, GIS modelling indicates there is a crossing located on Glen Vowell Creek (modelled crossing ID 8300064). This area was canvassed and there was no culvert or structure found. In 2018, [@tritonenvironmentalconsultantsltd_2020GlenVowell] electrofished a section of Glen Vowell Creek upstream of modelled crossing 8301266 and inventoried cutthroat and dolly varden. This stream flows east before draining into the Skeena River. Immediately before the confluence, GIS modelling indicates there is a crossing located on Peter Brown Drive (modelled crossing ID 8300001). However, this location was also investigated and there was no crossing found. There are some discrepencies between the mapped stream channels in the BC freshwater atlas and the actual on the ground reality. This could be the result of anthroprogenic influences (example: dredged stream channels or channel redirection due to protection of road and community infrastructure).  

<br>

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198217)). At the time of reporting, there was no
fisheries information available for the area upstream of the highway crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` [@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs]. Local knowledge holder (Chief Francis), noted that the local community used to historically harvest coho from the stream. Gitxsan Watershed Authority and local residents are working together to gather information about the system from elders and other local knowledge holders in the community to help inform watershed restoration planning.  There is concern in the community that the stream flows are not as consistent as in the past and there are hopes that restoration activities could help increase fisheries productivity in the system. There is a network of dykes surrounding the Sik-e-Dakh community.

## Stream Characteristics at Crossings {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was embedded, backwatered and
ranked as
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result)`
to upstream fish passage (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198216)). There
were two culverts side by side, and both of them had trash racks on the
inlet side that could be a barrier to adult coho. The trash rack had
grid sizes of approximately 13cm by 13cm (shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:photo-198216-rack)).

<br>

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(site = my_site2, col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198217)). There
were two perched culverts present side by side, with good flow but a
0.6m outlet drop. Water temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "ds", col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C,
pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "ds", col_pull = 'p_h')` and
conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(sit = my_site2, loc = "ds", col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream of `r as.character(my_site)` {.unnumbered}

The area downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` consisted of open wetland habitat with shrubs and floodplains. There was a beaver dam approximately 100m downstream of the culvert. Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output(" presented in Figures \\@ref(fig:ortho-caption-198216) - \\@ref(fig:model-caption-198216).")} else knitr::asis_output("presented [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public/744a9804752947d9ba769e53b8c9deec/) and [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public_3D/744a9804752947d9ba769e53b8c9deec/).")`

`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2)` The area surveyed was mostly wetland habitat, with
three big beaver dams spaced evenly along surveyed length. Multiple
channels were present after the first beaver dam, separated by heavily
vegetated banks. There was muddy bed material with some fines and
gravels but nothing bigger. More gravels were present closer to crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` that were suitable for spawning. There were abundant deep pools
present near wetland that could be suitable for rearing if habitat is
opened up. The habitat was rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds', sit = my_site2)` value as an important
migration corridor containing suitable spawning habitat and having
moderate rearing potential for resident and anadromous salmonids. The area immediately upstream of
`r as.character(my_site)` was also surveyed by drone

Three sections of stream were surveyed. The first section was surveyed upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` for `r fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198217-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2)` Abundant gravels were present
suitable for coho, steelhead, and rainbow spawning. Multiple large beaver dams were
present within the area surveyed. The upstream end of site was
adjacent to a beaver dam complex. The habitat was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us', sit = my_site2)` value for salmonid
rearing and spawning.

<br>

The second section was surveyed on an upstream tributary to the main stream for `r fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us2', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us2', sit = my_site2)` There was extensive beaver activity in this section. This was a steeper, smaller stream with extensive areas of gravel suitable for resident and anadronous salmonids. Multiple small steps from large and small woody debris with heights ranging from 20-40cm were present at the time of survey. The stream was surrounded by an old growth riparian forest. The habitat was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us2', sit = my_site2)` value for salmonid
rearing and spawning. 

<br>

The third section was surveyed on a tributary to the mainstem for `r fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us3', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m. `r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us3', sit = my_site2)` This is a major contributing tributary to downstream flow. Abundant gravels were present suitable for spawning. There were sporadic pools suitable for juvenile coho and steelhead overwintering. The mature old growth mixed riparian provided a stable channel and large woody debris. Wildlife trails were found throughout the forest. The habitat was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us3', sit = my_site2)` value for salmonid
rearing and spawning.

<!-- ## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered} -->

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

There was
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat modelled upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site2, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for coho rearing and spawning. Electrofishing upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` and within the north tributary is recommended to provide insight into fish
community composition and density. Beaver management and riparian restoration are important steps to the conservation of this system. A plan to conserve and rehabilitate this system is being layed out by the Gitxsan Watershed Authority, in collaboration with the local community.
