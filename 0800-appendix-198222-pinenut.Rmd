## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
`r fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = road_name)` on
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()`, approximately 15km north east of the small community of Glen Vowell, BC.
Crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was located
`r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Skeena River.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info()` is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_min')`m near the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198222)). At the time of reporting, there was no fisheries information available
for the area upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`[@moe2020KnownBC; @norris2022smnorrisbcfishobs].

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-198222, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

<br>

PSCIS stream crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a high
priority for follow up by the Society for Ecosystem Restoration in Northern BC due to significant quantities of habitat
upstream modelled by `bcfishpass` as likely suitable for salmon rearing.
A summary of habitat modelling outputs is presented in Table
\@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198222) and a map of the watershed is
provided in map attachment
[`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "kisp", archive_date = "2022-09-06")`).

## Stream Characteristics at Crossing {.unnumbered}

At the time of the survey, PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was
un-embedded, non-backwatered and ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()`
to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol
[@moe2011Fieldassessment] (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198222)). The
culvert was considered a complete barrier to all species and all life
stages at all flows due to an outlet drop measured at
`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = outlet_drop_meters)`m high. The
deep and large outlet pool indicated that the culvert was significantly
undersized. Condition of the pipe was noted as poor with extensive
corrosion present and some collapsing in the middle of the pipe. Water
temperature was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c')`$^\circ$C, pH
was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h')` and conductivity was
`r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm')`uS/cm.

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'ds')`
`r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198222-01) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198222-02)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198222-d01))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'ds')` The habitat
was rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds')` value for
salmonid rearing and spawning.

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

`r fpr_my_survey_dist(loc = 'us')` `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("(Figures \\@ref(fig:photo-198222-03) - \\@ref(fig:photo-198222-06)).")}else(knitr::asis_output("(Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-198222-d02))."))`
`r fpr_my_habitat_paragraph(loc = 'us')` There was a large woody debris jam 1.3m in height located approximately 500m upstream of the crossing. This obstacle would be passable for adult salmonids but dependent on flow conditions it is likely a fish passage issue for the upstream migration of all life stages of resident populations as well as non-adult salmonids. This is a high energy system with numerous areas of multiple channel, islands and elevated bars. High flows were pushing most large woody debris out of the main channel resulting in lower complexity and most cover was available as boulders. There were rare pockets of gravel suitable for spawning. Overall, the habitat surveyed upstream of the crossing was
rated as `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us')` value as an important
migration corridor containing habitat suitable for spawning with moderate rearing potential.

<br>

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

To assess potential impacts of the culvert on fisheries values in the stream, minnowtrapping was conducted upstream and downstream of the crossing.  One `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_us')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish was captured upstream with `r tab_fish_summary %>% filter(site_id == paste0(my_site, '_ds')) %>% group_by(site_id) %>% janitor::adorn_totals() %>% filter(site_id == 'Total') %>% pull(count_fish)` fish captured downstream. Only Dolly Varden were captured.

<br>

```{r tab-fish-dens-198222, eval=T}
source('scripts/functions.R')
my_caption <- paste0('Fish captured in minnowtraps set overnight upstream and downstream of PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.')

tab_fish_mt() %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = my_caption)
```

## Structure Remediation and Cost Estimate {.unnumbered}

Should restoration/maintenance activities proceed, replacement of PSCIS
crossing `r as.character(my_site)` with a bridge
(`r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(col_pull = recommended_diameter_or_span_meters)`m
span) is recommended. The cost of the work is estimated at
\$`r format(fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(), big.mark = ',')` for a cost
benefit of `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_net)` linear
m/\$1000 and `r fpr::fpr_my_cost_estimate(col_pull = cost_area_net)`
m^2^/\$1000.

<br>

## Conclusion {.unnumbered}

Modelling indicates 
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull= upstream_habitat_length_km)`km of
habitat upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` suitable for steelhead rearing with
areas surveyed rated as
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(sit = my_site, loc = 'us', col_pull = hab_value)`
value for rearing and spawning. Crossing
`r as.character(my_site)` was ranked as a
`r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(col_pull = priority)` priority for
proceeding to design for replacement.
